##  importing all the necessary python packages


# solution 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("The packages have been successfully imported")

```


```Python
# reading the sales data into a pandas dataframe

####  Data Modification
```Python
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df







# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 





# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()
```

## DATA ANALYSIS 
#### DATA FILTERING 

```Python
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bike_in_the_US = bikes_df[ (is_usa) & (is_bike) ]

bike_in_the_US.head()

```

#### DATA AGGREGATION

```Python
# aggregating the total profit by states in the United States for bikes sales  

total_profits_by_states = bike_in_the_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum )

total_profits_by_states
```

#### DATA SORTING 
```Python
# Sorting the aggregated data 
# in order to rank the states according to top most-profitable states

total_profits_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)

```
