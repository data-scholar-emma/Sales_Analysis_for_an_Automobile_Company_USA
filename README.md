# Sales_Analysis_for_an_Automobile_Company_USA
A Data Science Project that Analysed  the sales performance of an Automobile company Based in the United States. The companyâ€™s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike Product Category in the United States ?

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING 
#### DATA LOADING 
```Python
##  importing all the necessary python packages


# solution 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("The packages have been successfully imported")

```


```Python
# reading the sales data into a pandas dataframe

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/HP/Downloads/dowlnoad 2/bikes.csv")
bikes_df.head()    

```

####  Data Modification
```Python
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df







# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 





# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()
```

## DATA ANALYSIS 
#### DATA FILTERING 

```Python
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bike_in_the_US = bikes_df[ (is_usa) & (is_bike) ]

bike_in_the_US.head()

```

#### DATA AGGREGATION

```Python
# aggregating the total profit by states in the United States for bikes sales  

total_profits_by_states = bike_in_the_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum )

total_profits_by_states
```

#### DATA SORTING 
```Python
# Sorting the aggregated data 
# in order to rank the states according to top most-profitable states

total_profits_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)

```

#### RESULT 
```Pthon
# The Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike Product Category 

# in the United States ?

top_5_most_profitable_states_USA = total_profits_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False).head()

top_5_most_profitable_states_USA
```


## DATA VISUALIZATION 

```Python
# visualizing the result 

top_5_most_profitable_states_USA.plot(kind = "bar")


# adding a title and label to the plot 

plt.title("The Top 5 Most Profitable States for Bike Product in the US ")

plt.ylabel("Total Profit in Million Dollars")

plt.xlabel("States")

# showing the plot

plt.show()


```
